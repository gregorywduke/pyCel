=====================================================================================
 pyCel is a Python application designed for specific data processing of Excel files.
=====================================================================================

 pyCel uses openpyxl, PySimpleGUI, and pyinstaller to create a simple, intuitive 
 application that makes Excel data processing easy. It was created to for a client
 to eliminate their workload and user error. 

 Given the client's dataset, pyCel will display a GUI and a series of prompts. 
 Each prompt will collect necessary files from the user. The application will
 then begin an event loop, and depending on the client's choices, will sort
 the Excel file accordingly. 

 pyCel also features a bubble sort algorithm that can sort entire rows by date. 
 pyCel is very robust and is capable of handling many changes in the dataset.
 That being said, this program will ONLY work with the client's dataset. The
 application was created for their personal use, and it will not serve any
 other purpose.
